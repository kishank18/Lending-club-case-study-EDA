Lending Club specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision: a. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company b. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default. The data provided by the company consists of loan data for all loans issued between 2007-2011. For this analysis a sequential approach is followed in which Exploratory Data Analysis is performed for different attributes which could be a factor affecting the default rate. Univariate, Segmented univariate and Bivariate analysis is performed to get some correlation between variables and default rate. Finally, recommendation is provided for the variable which can help in estimating an applicant will default or not.
